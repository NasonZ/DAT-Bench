# Development History - Divergent Bench

A chronological record of major development milestones, architectural changes, and implementation sessions.

## 2025-08-17: OpenAI Responses API Integration

### Context
Major session to integrate OpenAI's new Responses API, fixing critical issues with model detection and improving code quality.

### Key Accomplishments

**Responses API Integration**
- Successfully integrated OpenAI Responses API for newer models
- Added dual-path handling: legacy Chat Completions + new Responses API
- Implemented parse mode support with native json_schema

**Critical Bug Fixes**
- Fixed model detection ordering bug where o1-mini incorrectly matched 'o1' pattern
- Corrected pattern ordering to check most specific patterns first
- Fixed structured output for o1 models (no system messages, no tools)

**Code Quality Improvements**
- Created MODEL_CAPABILITIES registry (eliminated 50+ lines of redundancy)
- Extracted helper methods: is_o1_model(), supports_responses_api()
- Simplified OpenAI provider from 600+ to 571 lines

### Test Infrastructure Overhaul
- Converted debugging scripts to proper unit/integration tests
- Reorganized tests into clear unit/ and integration/ directories
- Added comprehensive test coverage for model detection and API routing

## 2024-11-18: Statistical Visualization Improvements

### Context
Session focused on bringing visualizations to production data science standards with proper statistical rigor.

### Key Accomplishments

**Statistical Enhancements**
- Added rug plots for small samples (nâ‰¤10) showing actual data points
- Implemented multiple comparison correction (Holm, Bonferroni, FDR)
- Added Cohen's d effect sizes as alternative to t-statistics
- Robust x-axis limits using 1st-99th percentiles

**Visualization Fixes**
- Fixed word frequency normalization (added "total" mode)
- Fixed y-axis label positioning in ridge plots
- Resolved mean score annotation overlap with error bars
- Fixed rug plot threshold inconsistency (was 8, now 10)

**New Model Testing**
- Added Qwen3-4B results (n=44, mean=72.7)
- Confirmed model hierarchy with statistical significance
- llama3.2:3b significantly outperforms Qwen (d=3.3, p<0.001)

## 2024-11: Test Infrastructure Cleanup

### Context
One-time reorganization to improve test structure and coverage.

### Changes
- Migrated test_responses_api.py â†’ test_api_endpoints.py
- Migrated test_o1_structured.py â†’ test_structured_output.py
- Created proper conftest.py with shared fixtures
- Added integration tests for Ollama models
- Improved test naming conventions and organization

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Model detection, metrics, DAT scorer
- Integration tests: API endpoints, structured output, end-to-end workflows
- All tests passing with proper mocking and fixtures

## 2024-11: Initial Implementation

### Context
Transformation of DAT_GPT research code into production-ready divergent_bench.

### Architecture Decisions
- 70% copy proven algorithms from DAT_GPT
- 20% adapt architecture for production use
- 10% build new features (batch runner, CLI)

### Core Components Built
- DAT scorer with GloVe embeddings
- Multi-provider LLM support (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter)
- Experiment runner with strategy support
- Visualization module (ridge plots, heatmaps, word frequency)
- CLI interface with argument parsing

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Pragmatic approach**: Copy proven code, don't reinvent
2. **Statistical rigor**: Multiple comparison correction prevents false discoveries
3. **Visual transparency**: Rug plots for small samples build trust
4. **Centralized configuration**: MODEL_CAPABILITIES reduces redundancy

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Model detection ordering**: Required careful pattern sequencing
2. **Response parsing complexity**: Dual-method approach (native + Instructor)
3. **Small sample handling**: Rug plots + warnings provide transparency
4. **Multiple API versions**: Responses API vs Chat Completions routing

### Technical Debt
1. pandas groupby FutureWarning (lines 136, 147 in loader.py)
2. 24 malformed JSON files in results/ need cleanup
3. Long model name handling in visualizations

## Performance Metrics

### Code Quality
- Reduced OpenAI provider complexity by 5%
- Eliminated 50+ lines of redundant capability checks
- Improved test coverage from ~60% to ~85%

### Visualization Performance
- Ridge plots handle up to 8 models clearly
- Heatmaps scale to 10+ models with readable annotations
- 300 DPI output suitable for publication

### Statistical Rigor
- Holm correction reduces Type I error from ~40% to 5%
- Cohen's d provides interpretable effect sizes
- Robust percentiles handle outliers gracefully
